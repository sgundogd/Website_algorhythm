    <h1>Project Overview</h1>

    <h2>1. Scope of the Project</h2>
    <p>
This project aims to measure whether it can accurately predict the emotional states conveyed by 
songs using multidimensional features. In addition to the Spotify dataset, album cover images and lyrics
 were used. The main goal of the project is to measure whether we can predict the emotion conveyed by a 
 song by holistically analyzing audio-based , visual (album cover) and textual (lyrics) features using 
 machine learning techniques. The project is based on the two-dimensional energy-valence matrix, which is Thayer's Mood Model to describe emotions. Songs are divided into 
 emotional clusters such as energetic, sad, calm, stressed. The main focuses of the project are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performing textual analysis (NLP) on lyrics to identify emotional expressions and integrate them into the model,</li>
      <li>Using visual processing techniques to analyze album cover features and use them for emotion prediction,</li>
      <li>Determining the emotional position of songs on the mood map using audio-based features taken from Spotify.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of this project is to create an innovative machine learning-powered emotion prediction system based on a multimodal approach.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Research Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How accurately can a song's emotion be predicted based on its audio features, visual features, lyrics and genre?</li>
      <li>To what extent do the visual features of album covers (e.g., color, contrast, visual density), song lyrics, audio features and genres align with the predicted emotional state?</li>
      <li>Among various machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM), which algorithm performs best in predicting a song’s emotion?</li>
    </ul>
